## If-Statements
```bash
i=0
if [ $i -ne 1 ]; then
   echo "i is not 1"
else
   echo "i is $i"
fi
```
## Variables and Subshells
The following bash snippet will change the variable 'i' in a while loop that runs in a subshell.
This is beacuse the arguments are piped into the while loop.
```bash
i=0
find . -type f | while read line
do
   i=$(($i + 1))
   echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done
echo $i         # Will NOT be increased
```
**i** will stay 1.  
In order to reference to **i** you need to use a so-called *Here-String* as described [here](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Here-Strings). The same code would look the following: 
```bash
i=0
while read line
do
   i=$(($i + 1))
   echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done <<< "$(find . -type f)"
echo $i         # Will be increased
```
**i** will be have the incremented value.
On the other hand the following for loop will reference to **i**. This is because **i** is not passed into a subshell.
```bash
i=0
for file in $(find . -type f); do
  i=$(($i + 1))
  echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done
echo $i
```
