1. Check UART pins outs (usually 4 in a row)


## I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit 
I2C is a serial computer bus that runs on 3.3V or 5V and looks like a chip with 8 legs/pins. It is used for low speed applications around 1Mbit/s using Bus Pirate while it has support for 3.4Mbit/s.

Requires two wires, namely:
1. Serial Data Line (SDA)
1. Serial Clock Line (SCL)

## JTAG or Joint Test Action Group
JTAG is more of a set of circuits that should enable debugging capabilities instead of a primary communication protocol.  
JTAG used up to 5 signals which are:
1. TDI (Test Data In)
1. TDO (Test Data Out)
1. TCK (Test Clock)
1. TMS (Test Mode Select)
1. TRST(Test Reset)

## SPI or Serial Peripheral Interfaces
1. SCLK (Serial Clock)
1. MOSI (Master Output, Slave Input)
1. MISO (Master Input, Slave Output)
1. SS (Slave Select)
