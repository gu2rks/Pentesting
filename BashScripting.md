# Variables and Subshells

The following bash snippet will change the variable 'i' in a while loop that runs in a subshell.
This is beacuse the arguments are piped into the while loop.
```bash
i=0
find . -type f | while read line
do
   i=$(($i + 1))
   echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done
echo $i         # Will NOT be increased
```
*i* will stay 1

```bash
i=0
while read line
do
   i=$(($i + 1))
   echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done <<< "$(find . -type f)"
echo $i         # Will be increased
```
*i* will be have the incremented value.
On the other hand the following for loop will reference to *i*. This is because *i* is not passed into a subshell.
```bash
i=0
for file in $(find . -type f); do
  i=$(($i + 1))
  echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done
echo $i
```
