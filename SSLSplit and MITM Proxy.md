# SSL Split

SSLsplit is designed to transparently terminate connections that are redirected to it using a network address translation engine. 
SSLsplit then terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination address, while logging all data transmitted. 
Besides NAT based operation, SSLsplit also supports static destinations and using the server name indicated by SNI as upstream destination.
SSLsplit is purely a transparent proxy and cannot act as a HTTP or SOCKS proxy configured in a browser.

For SSL and HTTPS connections, SSLsplit generates and signs forged X509v3 certificates on-the-fly, mimicking the original server certificate’s subject DN, subjectAltName extension and other characteristics. 
SSLsplit has the ability to use existing certificates of which the private key is available, instead of generating forged ones. 
SSLsplit supports NULL-prefix CN certificates but otherwise does not implement exploits against specific certificate verification vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS stacks.
