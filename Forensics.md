# Hidden File Compartments
The NTFS file system provides applications the ability to create alternate data streams of information. By default, all data is stored in a file's main unnamed data stream, but by using the syntax 'file:stream', you are able to read and write to alternates.

# Find them
```console
Get-Item -path .\hello.txt -stream *
```

# Read them out
```console
Get-Content -path .\hello.txt -stream hidden
```
