###### NMAP #######

nmap -sP   
When this command runs nmap tries to ping the given IP address range to check if the hosts are alive. 
If ping fails it tries to send syn packets to port 80 (SYN scan). 
This is not hundred percent reliable because modern host based firewalls block ping and port 80. 
Windows firewall blocks ping by default.

nmap -sP -P0
The -P0 flag skips the host discovery process and tries to perform a port scan on all the IP addresses (In this case even vacant IP addresses will be scanned). 
This will take a large amount of time but it will give you the results.

sudo nmap -sP -PS22,3389 192.168.2.1/24 #custom TCP SYN scan
sudo nmap -sP -PU161 192.168.2.1/24 #custom UDP scan
The better option would be to specify custom ports for scanning. 
Nmap allows you to probe specific ports with SYN/UDP packets. 
Probe commonly used ports e.g. TCP-22 (ssh) or TCP-3389 (windows remote desktop) or UDP-161 (SNMP).
