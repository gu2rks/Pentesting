# Binwalk
Binwalk is a fast, easy to use tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images (https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk).  
Example:  
binwalk -Me > results.txt

# Firmadyne
FIRMADYNE is an automated and scalable system for performing emulation and dynamic analysis of Linux-based embedded firmware. It can be found here --> https://github.com/firmadyne/firmadyne.
The components are:
1. modified kernels (MIPS: v2.6.32, ARM: v4.1, v3.10) for instrumentation of firmware execution;
1. a userspace NVRAM library to emulate a hardware NVRAM peripheral;
1. an extractor to extract a filesystem and kernel from downloaded firmware;
1. small console application to spawn an additional shell for debugging;
1. and a scraper to download firmware from 42+ different vendors.

# Firmwalker
A simple bash script for searching the extracted or mounted firmware file system (https://github.com/craigz28/firmwalker).
It will search through the extracted or mounted firmware file system for things of interest such as:
1. etc/shadow and etc/passwd
1. list out the etc/ssl directory
1. search for SSL related files such as .pem, .crt, etc.
1. search for configuration files
1. look for script files
1. search for other .bin files
1. look for keywords such as admin, password, remote, etc.
1. search for common web servers used on IoT devices
1. search for common binaries such as ssh, tftp, dropbear, etc.
1. search for URLs, email addresses and IP addresses
1. Experimental support for making calls to the Shodan API using the Shodan CLI
