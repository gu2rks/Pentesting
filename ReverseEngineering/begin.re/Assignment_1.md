## Riddles

### 1. What is foo in the following example? How much space does it occupy in memory?

.data
   foo DW 1,1,2,3,5

#### Answer
DW = 16bit = 2 Byte * 5 = 10 Byte

### 2. What is the value stored in EAX by the end of this code?

mov eax,0x2
mov ebx,eax
shl eax,0x2
add eax,ebx
and eax,0x8

#### Answer
```
mov eax,0x2   eax= 00000010
mov ebx,eax   ebx= 00000010
shl eax,0x2   eax= 00001000	 //Shift left by 2 bits

              ebx= 00000010
              eax= 00001000
add eax,ebx   eax= 00001010
              
              0x8= 00001000
and eax,0x8   eax= 00001010 // and means if both hold 1 at the same spot it becomes 1
              eax= 00001000
```
eax holds the value 0x8

### 3. Bonus: what should be the value of EAX at the beginning of the following code, such that by the end of it, EAX = 0?

xor eax, eax
#### Answer
Any value, since xor on the same value always returns 0.
