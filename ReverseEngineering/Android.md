# Code Sigining
Manifest.MF file calculates a hash of every file thats in the APK (classes.dex,abc.properties,...)  
Here is an example for WhatsApp:  
`
Manifest-Version: 1.0

Name: AndroidManifest.xml
SHA1-Digest: 0pkPSIYR0GXNiJmqBxSNVwR6u1k=

Name: annotations/Assertions.java
SHA1-Digest: /I92B6ZXItkJyZEoLOci37tP+yM=

Name: annotations/Mutable.java
SHA1-Digest: ph1VThOqpM3KA4jBSuPdnu+/28w=

...  
`

One could say that we could just change the files we need and then recalculate the hash and update that hash in the MANIFEST.MF file but there is anothter file called CERT.SF which calculates the hash of the entire MANIFEST.MF file. Further it hashes the name and the sha1 hash (including the keywords "Name: " and "SHA1-Digest: " and appends it to the file. It can be seen below:  

`
Signature-Version: 1.0
Created-By: 1.0 (Android)
SHA1-Digest-Manifest: 8HMbYddN2C/g74emSPXgetDPiek=
X-Android-APK-Signed: 2, 3  

Name: AndroidManifest.xml
SHA1-Digest: cOhEgI9PcdVrP0WX8qglspuIzOk=  

Name: annotations/Assertions.java
SHA1-Digest: Kz5Cc2TjYqn3L1tta5tYdNCCQao=  

Name: annotations/Mutable.java
SHA1-Digest: hBVtpQZ4O59Wg4wgIltwRxhBgEw=  

...
`

Then we could still rehash the MANIFEST.MF file and then rehash he CERT.SF file
