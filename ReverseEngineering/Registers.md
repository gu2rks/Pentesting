## Volatility
Some registers are typically volatile across functions, and others remain unchanged. This is a feature of the compiler's standards and must be looked after in the code, registers are not preserved automatically (although in some assembly languages they are -- but not in x86). What that means is, when a function is called, there is no guarantee that volatile registers will retain their value when the function returns, and it's the function's responsibility to preserve non-volatile registers.

The conventions used by Microsoft's compiler are:  
* Volatile: ecx, edx
* Non-Volatile: ebx, esi, edi, ebp
* Special: eax, esp (discussed later)

## General Purpose Registers
This section will look at the 8 general purpose registers on the x86 architecture.

### eax
eax is a 32-bit general-purpose register with two common uses: to store the return value of a function and as a special register for certain calculations. It is technically a volatile register, since the value isn't preserved. Instead, its value is set to the return value of a function before a function returns. Other than esp, this is probably the most important register to remember for this reason. eax is also used specifically in certain calculations, such as multiplication and division, as a special register. That use will be examined in the instructions section.

Here is an example of a function returning in C:  
return 3;  // Return the value 3

Here's the same code in assembly:  
mov eax, 3 ; Set eax (the return value) to 3
ret        ; Return

### ebx
ebx is a non-volatile general-purpose register. It has no specific uses, but is often set to a commonly used value (such as 0) throughout a function to speed up calculations.

### ecx
ecx is a volatile general-purpose register that is occasionally used as a function parameter or as a loop counter.

Functions of the "__fastcall" convention pass the first two parameters to a function using ecx and edx. Additionally, when calling a member function of a class, a pointer to that class is often passed in ecx no matter what the calling convention is.

Additionally, ecx is often used as a loop counter. for loops generally, although not always, set the accumulator variable to ecx. rep- instructions also use ecx as a counter, automatically decrementing it till it reaches 0. This class of function will be discussed in a later section.

### edx
edx is a volatile general-purpose register that is occasionally used as a function parameter. Like ecx, edx is used for "__fastcall" functions. Besides fastcall, edx is generally used for storing short-term variables within a function.

### esi
esi is a non-volatile general-purpose register that is often used as a pointer. Specifically, for "rep-" class instructions, which require a source and a destination for data, esi points to the "source". esi often stores data that is used throughout a function because it doesn't change.

### edi
edi is a non-volatile general-purpose register that is often used as a pointer. It is similar to esi, except that it is generally used as a destination for data.

### ebp
ebp is a non-volatile general-purpose register that has two distinct uses depending on compile settings: it is either the frame pointer or a general purpose register.

If compilation is not optimized, or code is written by hand, ebp keeps track of where the stack is at the beginning of a function (the stack will be explained in great detail in a later section). Because the stack changes throughout a function, having ebp set to the original value allows variables stored on the stack to be referenced easily. This will be explored in detail when the stack is explained.  
If compilation is optimized, ebp is used as a general register for storing any kind of data, while calculations for the stack pointer are done based on the stack pointer moving (which gets confusing -- luckily, IDA automatically detects and corrects a moving stack pointer!)

### esp
esp is a special register that stores a pointer to the top of the stack (the top is actually at a lower virtual address than the bottom as the stack grows downwards in memory towards the heap). Math is rarely done directly on esp, and the value of esp must be the same at the beginning and the end of each function. esp will be examined in much greater detail in a later section.
