## Bus Pirate

The Shikra should be faster.

## I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit 
I2C is a serial computer bus that runs on 3.3V or 5V and looks like a chip with 8 legs/pins. It is used for low speed applications around 1Mbit/s using Bus Pirate while it has support for 3.4Mbit/s.

Requires two wires, namely:
1. Serial Data Line (SDA)
1. Serial Clock Line (SCL)

## JTAG or Joint Test Action Group
JTAG is more of a set of circuits that should enable debugging capabilities instead of a primary communication protocol.  
JTAG used up to 5 signals which are:
1. TDI (Test Data In)
1. TDO (Test Data Out)
1. TCK (Test Clock)
1. TMS (Test Mode Select)
1. TRST(Test Reset)

Some common pinouts[19] for 2.54 mm (0.100 in) pin headers are:
* ARM 2×10 pin (or sometimes the older 2×7), used by almost all ARM based systems
* MIPS EJTAG (2×7 pin) used for MIPS based systems
* 2×5 pin Altera ByteBlaster-compatible JTAG extended by many vendors
* 2×5 pin AVR extends Altera JTAG with SRST (and in some cases TRST and an event output)
* 2×7 pin Texas Instruments used with DSPs and ARM-based products such as OMAP
* 8 pin (single row) generic PLD JTAG compatible with many Lattice ispDOWNLOAD cables
* MIPI10-/20-connectors (1.27 mm 050") for JTAG, cJTAG and SWD

## SPI or Serial Peripheral Interfaces
SPI is faster and consumes less power than I2C
1. SCLK (Serial Clock)
1. MOSI (Master Output, Slave Input)
1. MISO (Master Input, Slave Output)
1. SS (Slave Select)

## Connecting to the chip
After find the correct chip and protocol we need to connect directly to the chip. This can be done using Lead Clips.

## Helper programs
Programs exist that help using the previously established connection.
### Flashrom 
Flashrom is used for SPI connections and can be found here --> https://flashrom.org/Flashrom
Example
```console
flashrom -p buspirate_spi -r spidump.bin
```

### OpenOCD
OpenOCD is used for JTAG and available here --> http://openocd.org/.
It is a bit more complicated than flashrom due to the increased complexity of JTAG. It is necessary to create a config file specifying speeds, size, and such but then the command is only the following: 
```console
openocd -f config-file
```
