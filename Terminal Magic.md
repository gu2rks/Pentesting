### Raise the elephant
The magic SysRq key is a key combination understood by the Linux kernel, which allows the user to perform various low-level commands regardless of the system's state. It is often used to recover from freezes, or to reboot a computer without corrupting the filesystem.Its effect is similar to the computer's hardware reset button (or power switch) but with many more options and much more control. 

The QWERTY (or AZERTY) mnemonics: "Raising Elephants Is So Utterly Boring", "Reboot Even If System Utterly Broken" or simply the word "BUSIER" read backwards, are often used to remember the following SysRq-keys sequence: 

On DELL computers SysRq = Fn
```console
Alt+SysRq+r  ( The LEFT Alt key ) ( SysRq is on the same button as print screen )
Alt+SysRq+s
Alt+SysRq+e
Alt+SysRq+i
Alt+SysRq+u
Alt+SysRq+b
```

### Using Netcat to move files
```console
Receiver:
nc -l -p 12345 -q 1 | tar xz -C /
Sender:
Sending site: tar czf - dump.txt | nc #IP #Port
```
### Find open ports + corresponding process ID
```console
netstat -plnt
```

### Add SSH-Key to keychain

### Download files via SCP
SCP uses the SSH protocol to copy files across system by extending the syntax of cp. 
```console
scp username@hostname:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/file
```


### Check shared libraries
As an example we can check the shared libraries used by /bin/ls on a x86 Kali box
```console
root@kali:~# ldd /bin/ls
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffee17c7000)
	libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007ff50526c000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007ff5050ac000)
	libpcre2-8.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre2-8.so.0 (0x00007ff505027000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007ff505022000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ff5052de000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007ff505001000)
```

### CPIO Files
Extract
```console
cpio -iv < directory.cpio
```
