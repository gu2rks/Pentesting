 # SMB
 Operates on port 445
 
 ## Summary (Wikipedia)
 In computer networking, Server Message Block (SMB),operates as an application-layer or presentation-layer network protocol mainly used for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication mechanism. Most usage of SMB involves computers running Microsoft Windows, where it was known as "Microsoft Windows Network" before the introduction of Active Directory. Corresponding Windows services are LAN Manager Server (for the server component) and LAN Manager Workstation (for the client component)
  
 ## Enum4linux
 Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to enum.exe formerly available from www.bindview.com.  
 enum4linux -a -u administrator #IP-ADRESS#
 
 ## nmblookup
 nmblookup is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP queries. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine. All queries are done over UDP.  
 nmblookup -A #IP-ADRESS#
  
 ## nbtscan  
 This is a command-line tool that scans for open NETBIOS nameservers on a local or remote TCP/IP network, and this is a first step in finding of open shares. It is based on the functionality of the standard Windows tool nbtstat, but it operates on a range of addresses instead of just one.  
 nbtscan #IP-ADRESS#
 
 ## snbmap
 SMBMap allows users to enumerate samba share drives across an entire domain. List share drives, drive permissions, share contents, upload/download functionality, file name auto-download pattern matching, and even execute remote commands.   
 
 snbmap -H #IP-ADRESS#
 smbmap -H #IP-ADRESS# -d WORKGROUP -u admin -password
 
 ## smbclient
 smbclient is a client that can 'talk' to an SMB/CIFS server. It offers an interface similar to that of the ftp program (see ftp(1)). Operations include things like getting files from the server to the local machine, putting files from the local machine to the server, retrieving directory information from the server and so on.   
 smbclient -L #IP-ADRESS#
 smbclient -L #IP-ADRESS# -W=WORKGROUP -U=admin -p=445
 
 ## rpcclient 
 rpcclient is a utility initially developed to test MS-RPC functionality in Samba itself. It has undergone several stages of development and stability. Many system administrators have now written scripts around it to manage Windows NT clients from their UNIX workstation.   
 rpcclient -U "" -N #IP-ADRESS#
 rpcclient -U "admin" -N #IP-ADRESS#
 
 ## nmap script smb-enum-shares
 Attempts to list shares using the srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll MSRPC function and retrieve more information about them using srvsvc.NetShareGetInfo. If access to those functions is denied, a list of common share names are checked.  
 nmap -script smb-enum-shares -p445 #IP-ADRESS#
 nmap -script vuln -p445 #IP-ADRESS#
