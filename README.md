# Pentesting

This is a collection of IT security topics encountered during my career as IT Security Consultant. I use it mainly to write down how I did things siince I tend to forget stuff. 
It still is quite messy and I need to find a satisfying structure but for now thats what we have to live with.

I do emphasize that I am not to hold responsible for what someone does with this collection.
