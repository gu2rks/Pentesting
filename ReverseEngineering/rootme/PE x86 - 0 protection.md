GHIDRA had problems parsing the file and would give me the error:  
"There were warnings/errors issued during analysis."  
Including the following dump:  
```
PDB> Incomplete PDB information (GUID/Signature and/or age) associated with this program.
Either the program is not a PE, or it was not compiled with debug information.

Unlike the previous challenges I did this one did not have a main function so I checked with radare2 and there I could find one by using the "aaaa" and "afl" commands. So I tried mapping the main function found in radare2 with one of the functions in GHIDRA. I tried comparing arguments, looking for the memory address (which did not yield a result). Then I thought I should check all strings to get some further help. So I found the String "Gratz man :)" and looked at the class in GHIDRA and found the collowing function:  
```c
void __cdecl FUN_00401726(char *param_1,int param_2)

{
  if (((((param_2 == 7) && (*param_1 == 'S')) && (param_1[1] == 'P')) &&
      ((param_1[2] == 'a' && (param_1[3] == 'C')))) &&
     ((param_1[4] == 'I' && ((param_1[5] == 'o' && (param_1[6] == 'S')))))) {
    printf("Gratz man :)");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  puts("Wrong password");
  return;
}
```
All parameter_1 chars will spell "SPaCIos"!
