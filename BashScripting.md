## String concetanation
```bash
var_hello="Hello,"
var_world=" World"
var_combo="$var_hello$var_world"
echo "$var_combo

```

## Output results/errors of commands to a file
Write stdout to file
```bash
foo > stdout.txt
```
Write stderr to file
```bash
foo 2> stderr.txt
```
Write stdout and stderr to different files
```bash
foo> output.txt 2> stderr.txt
```
Wite stdout and stderr to the same file
```bash
foo > allout.txt 2>&1
```
## If-Statements
```bash
i=0
if [ $i -ne 1 ]; then
   echo "i is not 1"
else
   echo "i is $i"
fi
```

## Modify key/value pairs in config files
```bash
log_size=80
target_key="max_log_file"
config_file="/etc/audit/auditd.conf"
sed -c -i "s/\("$target_key" *= *\).*/\1$log_size/" $config_file
```


## Variables and Subshells
The following bash snippet will change the variable 'i' in a while loop that runs in a subshell.
This is beacuse the arguments are piped into the while loop.
```bash
i=0
find . -type f | while read line
do
   i=$(($i + 1))
   echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done
echo $i         # Will NOT be increased
```
**i** will stay 1.  
In order to reference to **i** you need to use a so-called *Here-String* as described [here](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Here-Strings). The same code would look the following: 
```bash
i=0
while read line
do
   i=$(($i + 1))
   echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done <<< "$(find . -type f)"
echo $i         # Will be increased
```
**i** will be have the incremented value.
On the other hand the following for loop will reference to **i**. This is because **i** is not passed into a subshell.
```bash
i=0
for file in $(find . -type f); do
  i=$(($i + 1))
  echo $i      # Will increase each iteration
done
echo $i
```

## Shellcheck for script analysis tool
https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck

Shellcheck is a static analysis and linting tool for sh/bash scripts. It's mainly focused on handling typical beginner and intermediate level syntax errors and pitfalls where the shell just gives a cryptic error message or strange behavior, but it also reports on a few more advanced issues where corner cases can cause delayed failures.
