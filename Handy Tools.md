# SSL Split
SSLsplit is designed to transparently terminate connections that are redirected to it using a network address translation engine. 
SSLsplit then terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination address, while logging all data transmitted. 
Besides NAT based operation, SSLsplit also supports static destinations and using the server name indicated by SNI as upstream destination.
SSLsplit is purely a transparent proxy and cannot act as a HTTP or SOCKS proxy configured in a browser.

For SSL and HTTPS connections, SSLsplit generates and signs forged X509v3 certificates on-the-fly, mimicking the original server certificateâ€™s subject DN, subjectAltName extension and other characteristics. 
SSLsplit has the ability to use existing certificates of which the private key is available, instead of generating forged ones. 
SSLsplit supports NULL-prefix CN certificates but otherwise does not implement exploits against specific certificate verification vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS stacks.

Example:  
sslsplit -k ca.key -c ca.pem -P  https 127.0.0.1 8443  https ::1 8443

# MITM PROXY
https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/tools-mitmproxy/  

Features:  

* Intercept HTTP & HTTPS requests and responses and modify them on the fly
* Save complete HTTP conversations for later replay and analysis
* Replay the client-side of an HTTP conversations
* Replay HTTP responses of a previously recorded server
* Reverse proxy mode to forward traffic to a specified server
* Transparent proxy mode on OSX and Linux
* Make scripted changes to HTTP traffic using Python
* SSL/TLS certificates for interception are generated on the fly

# Hash-identifier
user paste a hash and hash-identifier will tell you what type it is (MD5,SHA-1,...)

# Mimikatz
Mimikatz is a great post-exploitation tool written by Benjamin Delpy (gentilkiwi). After the initial exploitation phase, attackers may want to get a firmer foothold on the computer/network. Doing so often requires a set of complementary tools. Mimikatz is an attempt to bundle together some of the most useful tasks that attackers will want to perform.

# XSSHunter
XSS Hunter allows you to find all kinds of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, including the often-missed blind XSS. The service works by hosting specialized XSS probes which, upon firing, scan the page and send information about the vulnerable page to the XSS Hunter service.
