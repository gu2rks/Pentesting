## tcprewrite
tcprewrite is a utility that enables us to quickly rewrite capture files such as pcap. This can be use to make it seem that a packet or a sequence had its origin from an arbitrary IP.

Export the pcap file from wireshark or tcpdump which should be tweaked to and the issue:

```console
tcprewrite --infile=tcppacket.pcapng --outfile=tcprewritten.pcapng --srcipmap=0.0.0.0/0:192.168.1.1 --enet-dmac=01:23:34:56:78:9A
```

The adjust the checksum
```console
tcprewrite --infile=tcprewritten.pcapng --outfile=tcpfinal.pcapng --fixcsum
```

## tcpreplay

Replay the packet(s)
```console
tcpreplay -i wlan0 tcpfinal.pcapng 
```
