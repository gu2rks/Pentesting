1. Check UART pins outs (usually 4 in a row)


## I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit 
I2C is a serial computer bus that runs on 3.3V or 5V and looks like a chip with 8 legs/pins. It is used for low speed applications around 1Mbit/s using Bus Pirate while it has support for 3.4Mbit/s.

Requires two wires, namely:
1. Serial Data Line (SDA)
1. Serial Clock Line (SCL)

## JTAG or Joint Test Action Group
JTAG is more of a set of circuits that should enable debugging capabilities instead of a primary communication protocol.  
JTAG used up to 5 signals which are:
1. TDI (Test Data In)
1. TDO (Test Data Out)
1. TCK (Test Clock)
1. TMS (Test Mode Select)
1. TRST(Test Reset)

Some common pinouts[19] for 2.54 mm (0.100 in) pin headers are:

* ARM 2×10 pin (or sometimes the older 2×7), used by almost all ARM based systems
* MIPS EJTAG (2×7 pin) used for MIPS based systems
* 2×5 pin Altera ByteBlaster-compatible JTAG extended by many vendors
* 2×5 pin AVR extends Altera JTAG with SRST (and in some cases TRST and an event output)
* 2×7 pin Texas Instruments used with DSPs and ARM-based products such as OMAP
* 8 pin (single row) generic PLD JTAG compatible with many Lattice ispDOWNLOAD cables
* MIPI10-/20-connectors (1.27 mm 050") for JTAG, cJTAG and SWD

## SPI or Serial Peripheral Interfaces
1. SCLK (Serial Clock)
1. MOSI (Master Output, Slave Input)
1. MISO (Master Input, Slave Output)
1. SS (Slave Select)
