# Mimikatz
Mimikatz is a great post-exploitation tool written by Benjamin Delpy (gentilkiwi). After the initial exploitation phase, attackers may want to get a firmer foothold on the computer/network. Doing so often requires a set of complementary tools. Mimikatz is an attempt to bundle together some of the most useful tasks that attackers will want to perform.
