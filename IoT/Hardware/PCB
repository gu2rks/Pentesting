## PCB identification

Find FCC online at https://fccid.io/

1. Check UART pins outs (usually 4 in a row)
1. Check for JTAG pinouts 

1. Check for SPI pinouts (8-legged flash chip)

## I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit 
I2C is a serial computer bus that runs on 3.3V or 5V and looks like a chip with 8 legs/pins.
